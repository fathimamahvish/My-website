        <i>
          I am Fathima Mahvish, currently in my third year at Kristu Jayanti
          College, Bengaluru, pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)
          with a specialization in Analytics. As an ambitious and enthusiastic
          learner, I have always been driven by a strong curiosity to explore
          the world of technology and data. My academic journey so far has been
          marked by a blend of theoretical learning and practical experiences,
          all of which have contributed significantly to my growth as a student,
          a team player, and a future IT professional. Kristu Jayanti College,
          one of the premier institutions in Bengaluru, has provided me with an
          excellent platform to build a solid foundation in computer science,
          data analysis, and business intelligence. The BCA with Analytics
          program is a dynamic and industry-relevant course that combines core
          computing skills with statistical and analytical knowledge. This dual
          focus has enabled me to develop not only technical capabilities in
          programming and databases but also analytical thinking that helps
          derive insights from data and make informed decisions. Over the past
          three years, I have gained hands-on experience in several programming
          languages including Python, Java, and C++, while also becoming
          proficient in tools such as SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. In the
          analytics domain, I have studied subjects like data mining, machine
          learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis. These subjects
          have deepened my interest in using data to solve real-world problems,
          and I am continuously striving to expand my knowledge through personal
          projects, workshops, and internships. In addition to academics, I
          actively participate in college seminars, coding competitions, and
          technical fests. These activities have allowed me to collaborate with
          peers, present my ideas confidently, and develop strong communication
          and interpersonal skills. I have also contributed to group projects
          that simulate real industry scenarios, such as building web-based
          applications, developing database management systems, and analyzing
          datasets to provide actionable insights. Each project has taught me
          the importance of teamwork, project planning, problem-solving, and
          meeting deadlines. One of the projects I am particularly proud of is a
          college event management system developed as part of our semester
          coursework. In this project, we created a VB.NET-based application
          integrated with a SQL Server database to help automate and manage
          events across various categories such as cultural, academic,
          technical, sports, and social. I played a key role in designing the
          user interface, handling category-wise data storage, and implementing
          dynamic controls for real-time event tracking. This experience helped
          me apply both my programming and analytical skills in a structured way
          and gave me confidence to take on more complex challenges.
